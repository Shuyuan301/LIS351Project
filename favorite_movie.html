      <p>Titanic is a famous American movie. This movie was adapted from a true story which was the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. The two main characters: Jack and Rose are from two different social classes, and they meet each other on board. Then they fall in love with each other very quickly. This movie is mainly talk about the love story between them in times of crisis. </p>
      <p>I love this movie so much since I can feel the strong love between people. I was so moved when I saw the captain saved women first and left himself in the dangerous ship. Even if this is a romantic movie, it still shows the positive attitude while suffering difficulties. </p>
